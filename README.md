Map Search (Grid)
Using a grid map space, an object will move from starting location to given location in the least number of steps. The grid map is blocked in certain parts, the algorithm of this program determines the best route to get to the destination without colliding with the blocked path. Program makes use of A star algorithm and calculating heuristic and manhattan values.


# Map Search (Grid)

Object starts from a  given location and reaches a target in least number of steps. The grid map is blocked in certain parts and it is the responsibility of the algorithm to determine, fine and traverse through the most optimized and available path on this grid (the algorithm determines the best route to get to the destination if the path not blocked on the grid).
